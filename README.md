This repository contains working code for a data exploration tool created using Python.

The goal of this code is to quickly understand data and generate a recommendation for the model to use based on the data provided.
This code will import, clean, and understand the data and provide a recommended model based
on the type of independent variable provided and the accuracy of some initial model fits. 

There will be limitations to each of the models as this tool can only do so much, but hopefully it eliminates
a lot of the need for trying to first understand the data and can reduce time to insights and producing results
back to end users.
